Articles should be added here within the correct directory.  For example, if I
have an article that I wish to enter into the Technology category, I would add
my article, in markdown form, to the "technology" directory here.

Notes:
* all filenames and directories should be lowercase
* all filenames and directories should use `_` instead of spaces
* all filenames should be prefaced with the date in `year_month_day` format (ie: `2013_08_01`)
* the `example` category is reserved for sample article templates
